# Rust CSG
Constructive Solid Geometry in Rust.
Create 3D objects using nothing but Rust code.
Combine boolean operations like *union*, *subtraction* and *intersection*.

## The *Csg* structure
The `core::Csg` consists of vertices bound together to form polygons.

The struct has basic transformations; *translate*, *rotate* and *scale*.
